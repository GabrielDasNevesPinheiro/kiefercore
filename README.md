# Slash Commands
<span>Inside the `src/bot/commands` directory are the files directed to your Slash Commands.
You can see two files already created, `Command.ts` and `Example.ts`</span>

#### `Command.ts` â†’ A class that you must extend in your command classes.
#### `Example.ts` â†’ An example of Slash Command, you can create any command following this model.

### Command attribute:
<span>You can customize your Slash Command directly through the `command` attribute:</span>
```typescript 
public static command: SlashCommandBuilder = new SlashCommandBuilder()
        .setName("imfree")
        .setDescription("I am freeeeeeeee")
```
<br>

### Execute function:
<span>Everything inside the `execute` function of your command class will be executed when a user creates the interaction.</span>
```typescript
public static async execute(interaction: CommandInteraction<CacheType>) {
    await interaction.reply({ content: "oizitos!" });
}
```
<span>You can imagine what happens when a user calls this command.</span>

#### Whenever you start the application, the commands will be sent to the Discord API, so they will always be up to date.
